We’ll also talk about <strong>people</strong>, and the difficulty of making them work together and techniques that facilitate the build of a successful team. We will remind you that it’s for bringing <strong>value</strong> to users that we do all this. And finally, we will not forget to tell you that this requires a change of <strong>mindset</strong>, some letting go and benevolence."
